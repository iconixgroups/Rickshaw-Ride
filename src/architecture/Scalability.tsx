// This file is a placeholder to demonstrate the architecture of the application.
// In a real-world application, scalability would be achieved through various means such as:
// - Using a scalable database like Firebase Firestore
// - Implementing efficient data structures and algorithms
// - Using cloud functions for heavy computations
// - Implementing caching mechanisms
// - Using a CDN for static assets
// - Implementing load balancing
// - Using microservices architecture for complex systems
